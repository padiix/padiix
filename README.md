## Hi there 👋

I like to code and learn new things!
My biggest weakness is inability to make stuff look good ( _except some graphics for some damn reason_ >:| )
<br> I'm currently learning C++ on [learncpp.com](learncpp.com)!

- ⚡ Fun fact: Hold <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and press <kbd>DEL</kbd> or <kbd>BCKSPC</kbd> to delete full words!

### I have created:
* **RecORDER [Python] [OBS]**
  * Organizes recordings/split recordings/replays/screenshots based on hooks of Window Capture/ Game Capture sources
<!--
**padiix/padiix** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
